A small collection of simple Python programs I made throughout late 2022. Archived here for sentimental reasons!

Included:
- A bouncy ball simulation featuring physics, written using PySDL2 (1-5 keys change the mass of the balls!)
- A game of Pong also written using PySDL2 (crude even by Pong standards)
- A PyGame program where you can draw with multicoloured balls, but they're affected by gravity...
- A function very loosely based on the PageRank algorithm that powered the original Google search engine.
